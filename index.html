             which Faiyaz said was warranted as he was "always distracted" by his love for music. Faiyaz began uploading his experimental music (Black Child EP) onto SoundCloud in 2014 and moved from his hometown Columbia, Maryland to Charlotte, North Carolina before settling in Los Angeles,
              California to further his music career. On January 19, 2015, he released his debut single "Allure". On June 1, 2016, Faiyaz released "Invite Me", the lead single from his upcoming debut EP.On September 19, 2016, his 21st birthday, the EP entitled A.M. Paradox was released and 
              received positive reviews from music critics.
